You've decoded the second message! Nice work!

... seriously, though, if you have not seen the Martian, you really should watch it. I'm not in the habit of reviewing movies, but it really is a great film.

However, one thing that really bugs me about the movie is that they left in all the great botany, chemistry, and mechanical engineering scenes, and cut out almost all of the computer-based problems that were pretty realistic in the book.
