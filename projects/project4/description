For this project, I challenged myself by putting all of the characters inputted by the user into an array which I made.  The first challenge I had was printing all of the members of the array, because I would often get garbage values being printed.  In order to circumvent this, after the initial while loop which gets data from the user ended, I added the null character to the last spot used in the array, to ensure that I would not get garbage values.  The second challenge which I had was figuring out the number of words that a user inputted.  If a user formatted their input weirdly, such as in the sentence " hello  my name is     Justin", using a method of only counting when a member of the array is not an alphabetic character does not suffice, as it would add extra words for all of the spaces.  Therefore, to make up for this, I only incremented the counter when the value inputted is a space *and* the previous value is a character.  Overall, I enjoyed this project a lot, and learned a lot about characters and strings.
